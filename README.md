# Any Audio Finder

This project is a server-side application for finding music using APIs.
It is built using the Ktor framework and utilizes the Exposed library for database handling,
Kotlin Coroutines for asynchronous programming,
Jsoup for parsing and manipulating HTML and XML documents,
and Koin for dependency injection.

## Technology

- Ktor: a framework for building server-side applications in Kotlin
- Exposed: a library for handling database interactions using JDBC
- Kotlin Coroutines: a library for asynchronous programming in Kotlin
- Jsoup: a library for parsing and manipulating HTML and XML documents
- Koin: a dependency injection framework for Kotlin

## Debug mode

To enable debug mode, set the environment variable ``DEBUG_MODE=true`` when running the app.
This can be done through various methods depending on the environment in which the app is being run.
Debug mode can be useful for debugging and testing the app,
as it may provide additional logging and other information that can help identify and troubleshoot issues.
